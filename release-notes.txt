FLARAS-2.0-r1296 - September 20, 2012

Completely redesigned development interface

Added mouse interaction support:
	- Left click on a point: enable point
	- Left click on a scene: go to the next scene
	- Right click on a scene: go back to the previous scene
	- Ctrl + click on a scene: disable the point

Added support for 3DS files with textures:
	- put the .3ds file and its textures on the SAME folder.
	- zip them and load the zipfile on FLARAS.

Added validation of numeric text fields
Added audio feedback for control forward and control backward interaction

Changed policy for treating files that was already added to the flaras project: 
	-Default policy before this flaras release: ask the user to rename
	-Default policy on this release: automatically rename them when the user inserts them.

Points and scenes can have labels
Ref. marker now supports two kind of bases/covers: white sphere and white plane

Changes on keyboard commands: 
	- check the new commands at FLARAS: "About" > "Keyboard Commands"

Simplification of interaction sphere design
Clearer error messages
Minor bug fixes and optimizations

-------------------------------
FLARAS-1.0-r1115 - July 19, 2012
AddedSupport for .3DS files (zip the file and insert it into FLARAS)

Optimization on loading 3D object files (much faster to load)
Support for DAE animations (after finished they will be automatically restarted)

Fixed bug: filenames (of obj3D, textures, videos and audios) with special characters and spaces used to cause instabilities. From now on there is a previous validation of the file before it be inserted to FLARAS Project.
